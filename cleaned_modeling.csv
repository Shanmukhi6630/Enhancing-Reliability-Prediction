"The AirPods arrived in excellent condition with no scratches or damages whatsoever, after using it for 1 month the sound quality is amazing and the exact same since the start, the battery life is also good. It fits in my ear nicely but is kind of loose if I’m playing sports which is expected. It functions well out of the box and keeps consistent, it’s easy to use as you can connect it to your device really easily and find it if it’s lost using the find my app. Overall a very good product, you should go for it",Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025,12,Yes,45,POSITIVE,0.6,6,0,1,RELIABLE,99

my primary usage is to dictate messages on WhatsApp and emails. The AirPods four does that perfectly. It integrates beautifully with the iOS dictation feature. I have tried at least a dozen other Bluetooth products, at prices equal to or lower than AirPods four,but everyone has lagged in dictation with many spelling mistakes. on bad networks, you can forget about trying to dictate even short sentences on any non-Apple Bluetooth device.

You can switch between Apple devices so seamlessly, it is almost magic.

There are so many nifty touches in iOS, which remind you that you are using an AirPod and not any other Bluetooth device. It feels very nice.

As somebody who also owns a pixel, I can confirm that AirPods are not much fun outside of Apple ecosystem. In fact at this price point, the in ear fit is quite pathetic for somebody like me with large ears.

This is the first Bluetooth device in years that I cannot wear while jogging because it feels so loose in my ears.

If you have the money, you can go all the way to AirPods Pro two. The pricing is Classic Apple, where this product is very nice, but the top and product is simply amazing.

The build quality is perfect, and as you can see in the video, the magnetic lock on the AirPods in the case is super duper strong.",Reviewed in India on 17 December 2024,29,Yes,130,POSITIVE,0.286,8,4,2,RELIABLE,236

"I strongly advise against buying this product. The overall user experience is very poor. The sound quality is subpar, and it frequently disconnects in the middle of calls or while playing music, which is incredibly frustrating.

To make matters worse, the product suddenly stops working and there is no reliable customer support available to help resolve the issue.

Should Amazon not spell out boldly that the cable usb is not included in the packet. Should it also not state that people often buy usb cable with it. Also that it would not fit into the charging port in the car. Both apple and Amazon come out in very poor light in this buy. Lo and behold shall need a new adapter too as the older one has been altered and yet again no mention of it before the unsuspecting buyers. So that’s 5000/- more to be spent.

I am writing to request a return for a pair of shoes I received on 13.06.2024. Unfortunately, I have noticed a defect in the shoes that occurred in the use of just a month. Which raises doubts on the reliability of the quality of the goods being sold by Amazon.

This happened during a match, causing my son's ankle to twist, forcing him to give up. I strongly advise against using these shoes. It's not just the poor quality that bothers me; it's the physical injury my son suffered. I trusted the Puma brand, but this product is a major disappointment.

"I had high expectations for this gaming chair, but the experience has been nothing short of frustrating. First, the packaging was terrible—the box was barely holding together, and inside, a few plastic parts were already scratched. To make matters worse, the nuts and bolts had visible rust buildup, which is completely unacceptable for a brand-new product.

Then came the assembly nightmare. There was no instruction manual included, and to my surprise, there were also no proper assembly videos on YouTube. I had to struggle through trial and error, wasting hours just trying to put it together. A premium chair should at least come with clear setup instructions!

The biggest letdown, however, is the height adjustment. Even at its maximum setting, the chair feels too low, making it uncomfortable for gaming or office use. If this is the “max height,” then it’s essentially useless.

Overall, this purchase has been a complete waste of money. I’m not surprised you guys didn’t get a Shark Tank deal—the product quality and user experience are just not up to the mark.

The manufacturer has significantly improved this chair! Initially, I was disappointed with the build quality, especially the legs, which were weak and broke within a month of use. However, they have now replaced it with much stronger legs, completely transforming the product.

The chair not only looks good but is now highly durable and sturdy. The faux leather finish feels premium, and the overall build quality is exceptional. I weigh less than 80kg, and this upgraded version has been holding up perfectly.

NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL,
worst chair. Within 2 months the chair mechanism started making noise, 1 month later to that the hydraulic failed (and I don't even adjust chair's height, one month after that, the armrest broke. After 10-11 month of uses the seat and and support pillows you can see the images. And now to the tilt adjuster malfunctioned (after warranty)

The only good thing about this chair is that CellBell provided new chair mechanism (TWICE), provided Hydraulic and armrest. The seat and pillows aren't covered in warranty.

Overall, this chair is waste of money. If you are spending above 15K then go for other better brands. This chair is not worth more than 6-8K.

Cellbell's customer support is contacting me and saying that they are sorry for the inconvenience I faced, and to compensate for this, they are talking about providing me an additional 6-month warranty (even after 4 years). I am increasing my rating only because their customer support is good.

"A comfortable chair and has good cushioning, although it has some cons too.
I am a developer and casual gamer, I am 6 feet tall and had back pain,
1. The headrest is not comfortable to support my neck, it has hard cushioning.
2. It supports my back well, I usually spend 10-12 hrs on the chair, and it's quite comfortable.
3. The base of the chair which supports thighs is not well designed or not has proper cushioning it hurts on thighs,
4. The height of this chair is good, arms rest are also good but it could be more comfortable there are bit far to rest both hands. It would be great if they could provide a 3d armrest at 16k then this chair would be best in the segment.
The overall chair is good. Shipment was fast. The packaging was good. It was easy to assemble, 2 person are needed to assemble the chair.",Reviewed in India on 13 September 2021,4,Yes,66,POSITIVE,0.308,8,2,3,RELIABLE,157
"a year has been passed with this chair i guess, well it's working like the same when it was new. lil bit of sounds comes from the bottom maybe cause of less lubrication, the back straps (pillow) got elongated somehow and now it's not that tight like before, so gotta take care of the straps, don't move them too much. overall a nice purchase, can look for greensoul too btw.

The chair started sinking now. and the warranty of hydraulics is only 6months lol

"I am satisfied with the quality of cushioning on this chair. Although it comes with its problems.

Few cons:
1) A few holes on the chair were not aligned, so all screws did not go through, although most of them did go through.
2) The height adjusting lever is in a spot were it cannot be moved. Although i am not using it so doesnt matter.
3) I am using this as a WFH accessory since this has more cushioning. However, one major drawback of the chair is that the arm rests are so far apart that you cannot rest your arms on them. Possibly since gamers have hands far apart for keyboard and mouse. This is the only potential deal breaker. I literally have to sit crosslegged on the chair to rest my arms on my legs :)
4) Difficult for 1 person to assemble, ideally needs 2 people. Another deal breaker. Installation is not very simple, although instructions are provided. Power tools might reduce the installation time.",Reviewed in India on 27 May 2021,9,Yes,74,NEGATIVE,-0.317,1,11,0,RELIABLE,169

No gimmicks, no fake fluff. Just a solid, reliable towel in a sea of overpriced scams. Glad I found it.",Reviewed in India on 1 June 2025,0,Yes,28,POSITIVE,0.514,5,1,1,RELIABLE,54

"You won’t exactly get the taste and feel of a mayo because this vegan mayo is nut and seed based.

"I really loved Boombay Sweet Mustard, so I was excited to try this. However, it was pretty bad tasting. First it hasn't emulsified, so when you open the jar, it is split and curdled looking. I gave it a good shake, and that helped somewhat. But the flavor is really unbalanced. It has a strong garlic flavor, but nothing else. It needs salt and seasonings to balance it. The overall recipe needs a lot of work. I like the concept, but it just needs to be improved. It is inedible in this form. I tried in a sandwich, and the whole sandwich was put in the bin because of the mayo. I did use it to make a dressing, and I was able to add ingredients with it to make a decent dressing, but it took a lot of work tweaking the flavors. So as a mayo, it isn't edible. But as a base to make a dressing or sauce, it has potential depending on your cooking abilities.

"I bought 55"" tv but faced display issue within 5 months. Product quality is ok (not good or not bad) but reliability is a concern.
Company service is extremely slow and pathetic as entire process of replacement is taking more than 25 days. (Still I have not received my replacement product) (complaint raised on 7th March 2025 and today is 5th April 2025)

Customer support is the worst in the market as no follow up Or courtesy from their end. I have called their customer support number n number of times but they dont pick any of the call.

I have called on their service person number but it is no use 90% of the time either he didnt pick your call or if he picked they only gives you false communications like ( aaj ayega pc, kal ayega , aa gaya hai, aj lagwa dunga kind if bakwaas )

My suggestion is rather than going for this cheap model by seeing price and features, it is better to go for reliable brands like LG and Samsung. (My previous model was LG 43"" LED which I have used over 12 years)

"A very good product worth the money paid

1. Reasonably well made product , good fit and finish though the plastic finish doesn't look as good as of some other expensive brands.
2. Picture quality good. To evaluate the performance, you should watch any 4 K or 8K demonstration videos . You will be surprised with the clarity and colour.
3. Sound quality is a let down but for this price range you cant complain.
4. Nothing much to write about but there are a lot of settings that can be done if one has the patience to go through the settings menu.
5. Installation was a disaster. It was scheduled for the day after I received the TV. No one turned up. I tried calling the number at least twenty times, no response, the next day i got a mail that it was reported that i was not in station and so installation could not be done , a blatant lie and so installation was postponed to after two days. This was repeated another two times . I would have called the number more than a 100 times no response. Finally after a week I decided to install the tv myself and found the process very easy but should have a very fast internet connection. The next day the technician called , I told him to get lost. Then he wanted me to share the OTP number with him , gave him a piece of my mind. The seller should really look out for some other vendor for the installation process. All this time I was in contact with the customer service who turned up to be very helpful.
Other than the installation it was a really good experience.",Reviewed in India on 19 March 2025,25,Yes,128,NEUTRAL,0.03,5,4,1,UNRELIABLE,290
"I bought TCL 75 inches 4K UHD LED TV after lot of research on specifications and price bargain.

This TV is really a catch @ Rs 69,990 when I bought in December 2023. Great deal on 75 inches TV. Thanks to TCL.

Moreover, the colours and brightness and viewing pleasure is really very satisfactory.

I was dreaming to buy Mini LED TV but it was very costly and out of my budget. So I closed down on this great value for money deal on TCL 75 inches giant screen TV at an amazing price tag of Rs 69,990.

Sound is 30W RMS. It's really crystal clear and very good to listen each minute audio detail. I have a soundbar but now no need to use it as the TV sound is almost like a soundbar and it's powerful.

TV has got HDMI eARC connectivity. I am using soundbar as well as Sony wireless headphone L600 - both with eARC connectivity. So it was super easy to connect my soundbar as well as wireles headphone with TCL TV seamlessly.

The remote controller unit is also very nice. It's bit slim and long which looks different from other brands and easy to handle. All required shortcut buttons are given.

It's a Google TV. So supports Google voice search.

We are very happy on our decision to buy TCL 75 inches 4K UHD TV.

I hope this TV will serve us for few years to come without any technical problems. I will post my post use feedback soon in next year 2024.

"We bought the TV 3 months back. In a month, the TV started getting hanged and did not work smoothly. Even after following all the instructions, the problem didn't get solved. Also the after service of the company is pathetic. When we asked to replace the product, they denied and did made reasons like technician will come and check the product. It's been more than 20 days we are trying to reach th but no one is responding to our complaint. Also the customer care number that is mentioned is of no use as no one answered or addressed our complaint.
There is Lag, poor picture quality before the TV started getting hanged. And now TV is not working at all. It's stuck on TCL logo and keeping getting restart, doesn't go ahead of it.
Never buy or go for TCL products as they don't respond or replace the product even when it's in the warranty period.

Just because it's less price, don't buy it as money gets wasted. Better to put extra and buy another brand.",Reviewed in India on 15 January 2025,0,Yes,69,NEGATIVE,-0.25,0,14,0,RELIABLE,177

We have purchase the said TCL TV on 19/12/2024. Exactly after 45 days we are facing problem in watching the TV. After switch on, it shows only TCL and no other action was seen. Initiated complaint about this but not get any response from the customer care.

After the visit from the service person, came to know that the Mother board was not working. How come only after 45 days of purchase mother board got damaged? Whether the TCL company is selling old or useless or third grade product to the customer through you. I dont know, this may come your knowledge or not, but as a customer its very disappointment and i have decided not to purchase any product through your online site.

I want full justification for this and i seek complete replacement of the product immediately.
