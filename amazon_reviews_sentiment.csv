"The AirPods arrived in excellent condition with no scratches or damages whatsoever, after using it for 1 month the sound quality is amazing and the exact same since the start, the battery life is also good. It fits in my ear nicely but is kind of loose if I’m playing sports which is expected. It functions well out of the box and keeps consistent, it’s easy to use as you can connect it to your device really easily and find it if it’s lost using the find my app. Overall a very good product, you should go for it",Reviewed in India on 15 March 2025,6,Yes,45,POSITIVE,0.45,4,0,0,RELIABLE

"Impressive! One of the best wireless EarPods on earth. If like me, you are not a fan of rubber or silicon eartips, this is best AirPods that you can buy. The sound quality is amazing. I’m surprised and in love with the clarity of sound, Spatial Audio is super impressive. What’s most surprising is even though it doesn’t have the silicon tips, the bass is just wow. I’m super happy with these AirPods. I have used AirPods, AirPods Pro 1 and 2. This one ranks right on top.",Reviewed in India on 11 February 2025,27,Yes,49,POSITIVE,0.5,7,1,1,RELIABLE

"my primary usage is to dictate messages on WhatsApp and emails. The AirPods four does that perfectly. It integrates beautifully with the iOS dictation feature. I have tried at least a dozen other Bluetooth products, at prices equal to or lower than AirPods four,but everyone has lagged in dictation with many spelling mistakes. on bad networks, you can forget about trying to dictate even short sentences on any non-Apple Bluetooth device.

You can switch between Apple devices so seamlessly, it is almost magic.

There are so many nifty touches in iOS, which remind you that you are using an AirPod and not any other Bluetooth device. It feels very nice.

As somebody who also owns a pixel, I can confirm that AirPods are not much fun outside of Apple ecosystem. In fact at this price point, the in ear fit is quite pathetic for somebody like me with large ears.

This is the first Bluetooth device in years that I cannot wear while jogging because it feels so loose in my ears.

If you have the money, you can go all the way to AirPods Pro two. The pricing is Classic Apple, where this product is very nice, but the top and product is simply amazing.

The build quality is perfect, and as you can see in the video, the magnetic lock on the AirPods in the case is super duper strong.",Reviewed in India on 17 December 2024,0,Yes,129,POSITIVE,0.111,8,5,1,UNRELIABLE

"Product is Apple iPhone 16e so given its enormous competition with Japan and South Korean phones a better presentation and literature is needed.
Product design does not allow it to locate inside the ear unlike the excellent fit of Jabra (both comfort, and ANC ) when you cannot change fit size and always slides out at night leaving you to grovel where it has gone in the dark.

Should Amazon not spell out boldly that the cable usb is not included in the packet. Should it also not state that people often buy usb cable with it. Also that it would not fit into the charging port in the car. Both apple and Amazon come out in very poor light in this buy. Lo and behold shall need a new adapter too as the older one has been altered and yet again no mention of it before the unsuspecting buyers. So that’s 5000/- more to be spent.
