# Enhancing Reliability in Predicting Amazon Reviews
This research focuses on developing an advanced system to predict the reliability of Amazon reviews by combining multiple techniques. It uses web scraping for data collection, APIs for structured retrieval, and machine learning models to classify reviews. The system employs prompt engineering for analyzing review text and Selenium to assess metadata, such as purchase verification. In addition to analyzing the content of the reviews, the system incorporates user engagement metrics like helpful votes, and verified purchase status. These elements help detect patterns such as sentiment trends, repetitive phrases, and sudden spikes in positive or negative reviews, which could indicate manipulation. By integrating these diverse data sources and advanced analytics, the system improves the accuracy of fake review detection. Its scalability and adaptability to new manipulation tactics make it a valuable tool for enhancing transparency in e-commerce, ultimately boosting trust for users and platforms alike.
